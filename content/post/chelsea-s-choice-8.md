  Last week we addressed many of the dos and don'ts of Instagram, and today we
  are going to expand on the subject of social media by discussing Instagram
  Influencers.


  _**What is an Instagram Influencer?**_


  Instagram Influencers are people who have established credibility amongst
  their vast fan base (followers). But if you think you can get paid
  sponsorships _just_ because you have 10k followers - you're sorely mistaken.


  Way back when - Instagram Influencers were paid purely because of how many
  followers they had. But now, you are judged and paid accordingly based on your
  **engagement**.


  **_What is engagement?_**


  Engagement is when your followers engage with _you_ and _your content_ (e.g.
  like, comment, share).


  _**What is considered 'good' engagement?**_


  Opinions vary a lot when it comes to - how many likes you should be getting
  with the number of followers you have. However, it can be easy to detect if
  your engagement isn't doing well.


  For example: if you have 10k followers, but only get 20-100 likes per post,
  your engagement isn't in good health and needs to get checked _ASAP_.


  _**How can I get better engagement?**_


  For convenience, here is a list of things to do, to increase your followers'
  engagement.


  _1. **P**ost **Q**uality **C**ontent_


  I don't mean to be captain obvious - but _good_ content equals _good_
  engagement. Although, having quality content is just a puzzle piece - don't
  expect to get better engagement **_only_** by improving your content.


  2. **H**ave **t**he **M**entality - **T**hey **a**re **F**riends **n**ot
  **F**ollowers


  Treat all of your followers like friends! Although don't get _too_ friendly,
  otherwise it might be a little bit strange...


  3. **H**ashtags


  As I mentioned in the previous blog, hashtags spread your content around and
  more often than not attract followers who are interested in your type of
  content and will engage with it.


  As an example:


  Greg is a twelve-year-old boy.


  He likes adventure sports such as mountain bike racing and water-skiing.


  He searches up the things he likes and encounters your page - because you put
  the hashtags #adventuresport #mountainbike #sports #racing #bikeracing.


  He loves your various images of people doing _sick_ bike tricks.


  He follows you, and whenever you post - Greg is ready to comment about how
  **_rad_** that trick was.


  Obviously, that's just an example. I don't assume you have a mountain bike
  racing and water-skiing Instagram account. But the same thing works with any
  and every hashtag.


  Are you a model? Use modelling hashtags. Actor? Use acting hashtags! Easy as
  that.


  **Next week will be more about your target audience, and how to define who
  your target audience is!**
