  Today we will be going through how to identify your target audience.
  Determining your target audience is massively crucial for businesses, and
  influencers to accurately reach your desired audience.


  This can help with practically anything. Anything that actively provides
  content for followers, subscribers or customers.


  Make up a few personas of people that you imagine would like your content,
  engage with it and bask in it.


  For example, let's say I have a business where I manage other companies social
  media accounts for them. This would be one of my 'Buyer Personas':


  **Get-It-Done Greta**

  understanding of who you want to follow you, and what content they would
  consume!


  Once you've determined that, base all of your further content on that simple
  outline - what content would my 'Personas' engage with?
