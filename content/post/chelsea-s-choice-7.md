  Last week we talked about the importance of social media - _Instagram
  specifically_. Now, I will be addressing the main dos and don’ts of
  Instagram. 


  Take note that some points in this list only apply to those who aspire to
  become models and/or actors. And that opinions may vary throughout the
  community.


  _**DON’TS:**_


  _1) **B**lurry **I**mages_


  \- Blurry images are generally unlikeable, and not pleasant to look at. Most
  people - myself included - overlook them. To a certain extent, we go out of
  our way to avoid such atrocities. Not only do people just, _don't want to
  look_ - but it seems unprofessional, daggy and lazy on the posters part.


  _2) **T**agging **C**ompetitors_


  \- If you are in the running for a major clothing brand, the worst mistake you
  could possibly make is tagging their competitors in an Instagram post. You
  _can_ and _will_ lose your job if you do so. In fact, recently, that exact
  thing happened. A model was booked for a photo shoot, but lost the job as they
  posted an image onto their Instagram wearing the competitors clothing and
  tagging them! 


  _3) **D**on’t **S**et to **P**rivate_


  \- if you have your account set to private - _don't!_ If you wish to get
  anywhere on social media, you need to be open to anyone who wants to follow
  you. I mean, do you see Ariana Grande going private? However, there is a
  slight danger as anyone can access your account - if you find anyone to be
  weird and uncomfortable, _just block them!_ No use in locking everyone out to
  avoid the occasional weirdo!


  _4) **D**on’t **P**ost **A**ll at **O**nce_


  \- It is a personal peeve of mine when I see someone post three times in a
  row. It doesn't help them in any way, as only the most recent post would get
  attention while the others are left to rot in its shadow. Posting multiple
  times within an hour is unhealthy for your posts, as it merely wastes a
  potential well-performing post! Instead of posting three at once, and only
  having one perform well, why not post them periodically and have them _all_
  perform well?


  _5) **D**on’t **U**se **T**oo **M**any **I**mages in **O**ne **P**ost_


  \- This is another personal plight of mine. When you add five images to one
  post, you wasted five separate potential posts. It's already harder to find
  something to post once or twice a day, _why make it harder for yourself?_
  Another reason why you shouldn't be posting more than two images in a single
  post, is that not everyone bothers to swipe! And not everyone bothers to wait
  for the ten other pictures to load either! Although it is not a crime, I
  suggest not putting six modelling images in one post as that post could have
  been divvied up into six separate posts across _three to six whole days._


  **DOS:**


  _1) **H**ashtags_


  \- Hashtags do wonders in spreading your post around Instagram. Your image
  will attract much more attention compared to when you don't use hashtags.
  However, if hashtags are overused, it can get messy and unpleasing to look at
  for your followers.


  _2) **A**nything **M**odelling and/or **A**cting **R**elated? **T**ag **Y**our
  **A**gency_


  \- It is a definite must for me. Tagging your agency is _vital_ when it comes
  to getting picked up for jobs! If a client looks at your posts and likes the
  look of you, and then they see your agency tagged - they will contact your
  agency _and possibly book you!_


  _3) **P**art of an **A**gency? **P**ut **I**n **B**io_


  \- Not only does it increase the possibility of being booked for a job, it
  just seems unprofessional - and often shady - if a model or actor fails to
  mention their agency in their Instagram bio.


  _4) **P**ost **D**aily_


  \- As I have mentioned briefly above, posting each day is recommended. As it
  ensures more engagement from your followers. And more engagement equals better
  performing posts! Also, make sure to post in time periods shown to have more
  active users, the times may vary depending on your content.


  _5) **B**e **Y**ourself!_


  \- Don't be afraid to dabble some personal posts amongst the gorgeous
  headshots! Remember, _people gravitate to people!_ Have a healthy balance of
  career-related and personal posts, and your engagement will be at it's best.
  People _love_ to see successful people as ordinary people too!


  _**Next week I will address social media once again, and expand on our
  knowledge!**_
