  If you want to pursue an acting career, you should make yourself familiar of a
  few things.


  **Video ID** is one of those things.


  A Video ID is quite simple in itself - for every single audition, you will be
  required to do a Video ID. Whether it be in front of a casting director, or in
  the form of a video to send to them.


  To film a Video ID you will need a clear camera - your phone’s camera should
  do, depending on the model of course. 


  You will need to have a piece of paper, or mini whiteboard, etc. Something to
  write your _**First Name, Last Name, Age and Agency.**_


  For example, if I were doing a Video ID, I would write on my piece of paper:


  _**Chelsea Glenn**_


  _**Age: 16**_


  _**Glass Management**_


  Sometimes you will be required to write more information on it, like the
  region you live in, your height, and more.


  Once you have written all the required information down, you will need to
  stand in front of a blank wall (preferably a white wall) and hold the piece of
  paper in front of your chest.


  Get someone to film you, and if they are shooting with a phone, it is
  _imperative_ that they **film horizontally.** This is also the case when it
  comes to Self Tapes.


  Otherwise, the video looks tacky to the casting director watching it.


  As if it weren’t already simple enough, it just gets simpler.


  All you need to do is look into the camera, smile and say:


  **“Hi/Hello, my name is \_\_(name)\_\_, I’m \_\_(age)\_\_, and I’m with
  \_\_(agency)\_\_.”**


  Depending on the brief, you may be required to state more.


  After saying all of that, turn to your left, then right to show the casting
  directors your side profiles. And viola! You've successfully filmed a Video
  ID.


  **Stay tuned for next week’s blog as I will be talking about Self Taping, and
  in two weeks time, Dialect/Voice Performance and Coaching.**
