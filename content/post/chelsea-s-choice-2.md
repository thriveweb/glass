  From a very young age, I have always found that trying something new is quite
  invigorating. Whether the change is significant, such as moving houses, or
  small, such as redecorating your bedroom.


  Recently, I felt like trying something new, so I went to a different
  hairdresser than my usual one. I found that even making the slightest of
  changes in your life can feel quite rewarding. And although my change was not
  as drastic as others, it felt fresh and exciting. 


  I believe everyone should be able to change things in his or her life.
  However, changing things such as your appearance, as a model there are some
  things you need to do in preparation for the change.


  It is great to experiment with your look, such as with the colour or cut of
  your hair. You stand out if you can show your potential clients what you look
  like with various styles.


  Being a model, your hair is one of your most definable attributes. And without
  proper pictures to show your new style, your agency cannot adequately
  represent you.


  For example: if you change your hair and dye it a different colour, it is
  _highly recommended_ that you supply new headshots, with your new look.


  If you feel like you need a new look, or you want to update it, I suggest MOD
  Hair Gold Coast. A local, creative and positive experience.
