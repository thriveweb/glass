  Gorgeous kids and TSS teachers strutted their stuff on the Catwalk in front of
  400 mothers for a Charity event for a Mothers Day High Tea.


  Dressed in fashion by Country Road and walking to the very inspirational "This
  is Me' from the Greatest Showman.


  37 Choir singers opened the number which led to a choreographed parade which
  was pulled off seamlessly.


  Great job kids and the teachers were pretty great too!!!
