  As far back as I can remember, I have always known that the choices you make
  today, define who you are tomorrow.


  In everyone's life, doors have opened and closed, and continue to do so.
  Plenty of doors have opened for me, and in some cases, doors have slammed
  shut.


  But what I have realised is that, as doors close, others open.


  In my case, a transparent Glass door opened. And with that, the opportunities
  that are within my grasp now, with Glass, are boundless to say the least.


  I think it's needless to say that, yes, making choices is often hard and
  sometimes frustrating. But I take solace in knowing that whatever choice I
  make - along with a little self-belief and hard work - I can choose my own
  path.
