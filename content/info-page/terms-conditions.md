  we cannot be held ultimately responsible for a model’s conduct on an
  assignment. We always strive to be inclusive of who is put forward for any
  campaign, although Glass Management is not responsible for who a client
  chooses.


  REPRESENTATION


  Glass will act as your agent for all paid acting / modelling work offered to
  you either through this Agency or from another source. Glass will negotiate
  performance fees for you at or above minimum Award rates. We will also sign
  standard industry contracts on your behalf and facilitate rollovers where
  appropriate. Glass is never deemed the employer always the agent, and will
  collect all money on your behalf deducting a commission of 20% on commercial
  work and 10% on acting work, for the service provided. In some cases you may
  be put forward for jobs which require you to work as a sub contractor
  therefore you will need to have or apply for an ABN number.


  PAYMENT INFORMATION


  Glass acts as your agent brokering deals on your behalf not as your employer.
  You are paid one of two ways either on the Employers payroll requiring you to
  fill in an employment declaration or as a Sub Contractor you will be required
  to submit a TAX invoice with an ABN number for payment. At the point of
  booking you for a job a Glass consultant will advise you of the method of
  payment.


  TERMINATION OF REPRESENTATION


  You can terminate your representation by Glass at any time. Notification is
  required in writing or via email info@glassmanagement.com.au


  Glass also reserves the right to terminate your representation if no contact
  has been made within a 12 month period. It is important for you to maintain
  regular contact with Glass via email talent@glassmanagement.com.au to avoid
  termination.


  PRIVACY POLICY


  Information is paramount at Glass as it is the ability to provide accurate
  details to clients in order to maintain a superior service. The Privacy Act
  1998 regulates the way Actors Ink uses your information provided by you.
  Personal Information includes any information from which you can be reasonably
  identified. This statement explains your privacy rights and our rights and
  obligations in relation to your personal information.


  TALENT CLIENT CONTACT & DIRECT WORK


  Talent will not do work directly for any Client that has been introduced to
  them by Glass either by way of a confirmed job or casting. Failure to do so
  may incur legal action.


  FEES


  To join Glass Management we have a one off small IT fee of $200 that covers
  the set up in our systems, as well as a profile on both our website and
  casting network.


  We endeavour to make a personalised plan for each talent member that is
  represented by us.


  Thank you.
