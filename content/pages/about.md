      Tegan has been in the Entertainment Industry for over 45 years (now you
      know how old she is!) With an extensive list of talents under her belt
      including Professional Dancer, Aerial Artist, Magicians Assistant,
      Choreographer, Personal Trainer, Model and Presenter. This has led her to
      both a national and international career path.


      Over the past ten years, Tegan has been able to successfully immerse
      herself into the Queensland market place with high end fashion labels,
      national brands, feature films, TV Series and local and national TVC
      Campaigns.


      She has worked with most of Australia's biggest fashion and corporate
      lifestyle brands across all industries and has developed long standing
      relationships along the way. As we all know this industry is forever
      evolving and because of her experience and communication skills, clients
      and talent feel confident in her ability to match suitable talent to fit
      the campaigns brief. 


      In 2021, she also launched Glass Studios - a custom made photography
      studio, not only for her clients to book but for any one to use. 


      Tegan has the entertainment industry covered in all areas and her can-do
      energetic personality means it's always exciting times ahead for Glass
      Management and always a new idea around the corner!
