        I am the Associate Director of the Warehouse Workshop Screen Acting
        Studio, a fully owned subsidiary of McSweeney Newman Casting


        I have known Tegan Glass for around 4 years as a professional working
        agent in SE Queensland and have had a strong business relationship with
        Tegan for that period of time. In that time, Tegan ran her agency with a
        high level of professionalism, care, honesty and importantly, integrity.
        The welfare of her clients holds paramount importance, and she works
        tirelessly to develop careers, and to work efficiently, professionally
        and effectively with the industry’s potential employers and key decision
        makers.

        I just wanted to say a gigantic and heartfelt thank you to you and the
        amazing children and parents who participated in the Bravehearts Day TVC

         The children (and parents) were an absolute delight and such professionals! Not to mention – such cuties!

        Once again – thank you, thank you, thank you to all the children,
        parents, and yourself!

        "We don't normally encourage children's shoot here on location due to
        the amount of stairs & retaining walls. It's a dream playground for
        children which screams adventure & makes it difficult for kids to sit
        still. BUT a huge congratulations to Ayo, Sophia & Jordan who acted
        professional on location for Cotton On Kids all day long!"

        "Many of the extras were envious of the Glass talent -- apparently Glass
        sends payment before all the other agencies do.


        Glass has a really good reputation amongst talent in the industry for
        being honest and taking care of their talent.


        Just wanted to pass on that wonderful feedback and congratulate
        yourself, Tegan and the team"

        brilliantly. He followed direction well and nailed it!"
