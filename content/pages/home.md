        I am the Associate Director of the Warehouse Workshop Screen Acting
        Studio, a fully owned subsidiary of McSweeney Newman Casting


        I have known Tegan Glass for around 2 years as a professional working
        agent in SE Queensland and have had a strong business relationship with
        Tegan for that period of time. In that time, Tegan ran her agency with a
        high level of professionalism, care, honesty and importantly, integrity.
        The welfare of her clients holds paramount importance, and she works
        tirelessly to develop careers, and to work efficiently, professionally
        and effectively with the industry’s potential employers and key decision
        makers.

        Hi


        I wanted to thank you both for yesterday. Tegan, the models were
        perfect. Little Heanan was a pro! And Nicole was lovely to work with.


        I  look forward to receiving the first edit.


        Kind regards,


        Sarah Davis
